      h2 Compact Design
      p The visual layout of Verbose Guacamole was designed to allow you as much space as possible to write.
      p The Git and Filetree panels can each be collapsed, and most of the more advanced features are hidden behind icons in the Novel Stats bar on the bottom. Even the word count status allows you to set goals when you click on it, and a progress bar will fill in its background as you write.
      p Finally, all of the extra UI elements can be hidden by toggling Focus Mode either by hitting <code>F11</code>, selecting <code>Tools =&gt; Focus Mode</code> in the application menu, or pressing the fullscreen icon in the menu of the editor.

      h2 The Future
      p Verbose Guacamole was built with the future in mindâ€”the codebase is built to be extended in the future to bring you highly requested features that didn't make it into the first release:
      ul
        li Split screen (edit two scenes side by side)
        li Third-party themes (or build your own)
        li Syncing between devices via Git
        li Multiligual support (for spellcheck, and potentially UI)
      p Best yet, <a href="/contributing/">you can help us build these features</a>!
