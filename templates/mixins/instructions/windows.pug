h2 Direct <code>.exe</code> File

p First, find the most recent version on the #[a(href="https://github.com/benjaminbhollon/verbose-guacamole/releases") Github Releases page]. Don't pick a version that's title includes "Beta" or "RC", those are preview releases and not intended for normal use.

p Open the accordion labelled "Assets" at the bottom of the release. Download the file that ends in ".exe".

p You should be able to open the file normally, and it will install and run VerbGuac on your system. You may receive a warning from your antivirus or Windows Smartscreen. If you trust us, you may safely ignore this warning.

h3 Upgrading

p To upgrade your version, follow the exact same steps and the new version will replace your old version. Make sure to close any running windows from Verbose Guacamole first!

h2 In the Future

p We are working on a system to automatically notify you when new updates are available. Until then, just check the home page of the app every now and then.
